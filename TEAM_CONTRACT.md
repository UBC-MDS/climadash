# Team Contract

## Team Commitments

The team is to develop a project that is honest in its scope and capability while producing quality work. An understanding should exist that this project will affect all members and as such, all members should act in a cooperative manner and keep each other informed as much as possible. All members shall treat each other with respect and operate in a constructive manner. Any form of abuse or harassment between members will not be tolerated and escalated to the academic faculty.

## Team Communication

Communication between team members regarding dense low-level topics/issues (e.g. git or code related topics) will be handled primarily through Github issues. Any other high-level topics will be handled through a Slack group chat. Members will try to check their Slack or Github issues page where possible to ensure cohesion within the team.

## Meetings

Prior to the meetings, members are expected to have read the week’s milestone requirements and are clear about what topics will need to be discussed. Any members with questions or concerns should write them down before the meeting to be answered and recorded during the meeting. Meetings will partake during the lab time for DSCI 532 for members to discuss and share their portions of the workload either online or in person. Slack hangouts will be utilized if any other pressing concerns come up during times where members are not physically available.

## Distribution of Work

Work will be split fairly and in agreement with all members of the group with clear understanding between all members what each task pertains. The distribution will occur during the team’s initial meeting once all members understand the tasks of the milestone. Consideration should be taken in regard to each member's prior contributions for the discussion of workload for each milestone. Larger/denser tasks should be given a primary member to lead the direction of the task and supporting members for additional help. 

## Review of Work

Where possible, all members are encouraged to review changes and documents within the project. When issues are raised or work is submitted for review, members should bring forth any doubts/concerns they have proactively and not before the milestone submission deadline. Reviews should be done sooner than later to ensure that members have time to make corrections or discussions. Once a pull request has been made, all members should be tagged and at least one member will review the code before approving the pull request.

## Work Submissions

Each week, one person from the team will be designated to submit necessary documents to Canvas and create the releases on Github. Though this member is responsible for the final submission, all members are responsible for ensuring that their work is up to the standard of the team and has been previously reviewed by at least one member prior. The following is a list of members responsible for the final submission for each milestone:

| Milestone   | Person |
|-------------|--------|
| Milestone 1 | Vikram |
| Milestone 2 | Mehdi  |
| Milestone 3 | Kelly  |
| Milestone 4 | Xinru  |
