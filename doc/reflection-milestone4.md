## Reflection:

Over the past few weeks, our team has been working to implement changes to our Canadian climate change dashboard. We have taken into account all of the feedback we have received, and have made significant improvements to the dashboard to provide a more interactive and informative experience for the user.

One of the key changes we made was to add more interactivity to the plots. We also adjusted the size of the dashboard so that it fits within one screen, making it more user-friendly and convenient to navigate.

Another improvement we made was to fix most of bugs and errors that were present in the previous version of the dashboard. We wanted to ensure that the dashboard was running smoothly and that all of the data was accurate and up-to-date.

One of the most important features we added was the tooltips, which use the Plotly library. These tooltips provide users with more detailed information about specific data points when they hover their cursor over a particular point on the plot. 

Additionally, we added a Leaflet map to the dashboard, which allows users to click on different cities to view more detailed information about the temperature or precipitation in that location. The color scheme of the map changes based on the selected variable, making it easy for users to visually compare different locations and see how they compare to each other.

Finally, we added a download button to the dashboard, which allows users to download the raw data directly from the dashboard. This provides users with more flexibility and control over the data, and allows them to further analyze the data on their own if they wish.

Overall, we are pleased with the improvements we have made to the Canadian climate change dashboard. We believe that these changes will provide a more comprehensive and engaging user experience, and we are excited to see how users will respond to these updates. We will continue to listen to feedback and make improvements as necessary to ensure that the dashboard remains useful and informative for all users.
